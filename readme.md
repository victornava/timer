# Timer

Is a simple and inaccurate timer for you to time unimportant events from the command line.

# Install

Drop the only file on your favorite bin/ folder. That's it.

# Use

The program accepts minutes as the only argument so you can try things like:

`timer 5`

Don't try it for more than 100 minutes or bad things will happen :P

# Notes
Sound only works on mac at the moment.
